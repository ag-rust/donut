# Donut Hash Algorithm
This is my donut hashing algorithm! It's a command line tool implemented in Rust that can hash any file you give it into a tasty donut. It's simple enough to build and use, just follow the instructions below.

## Building and Usage
To build the program, simply run `cargo build`. Once that's done you can run it with `cargo run input [output]`. *input* is the path to the file that you want to hash, and *output* is an optional path to the output of the program. It should be a PNG file.
